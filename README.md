### My portfolio website

- Trex game - Basically another version of the game on Google which comes when you don't have internet. If you don't know what this game is, it's a game where you need to jump over cacti, and it progressively gets faster. Eventually, it will be too fast for you to do (that's the goal)
- Stephen Curry Portfolio - This is a small website on my favorite basketball player, Stephen Curry. In this website, there is a small place about himself and there are a few videos on his highlights. By the way, there are contacts on the bottom (his address and his email) which are not real (THEY ARE MADE UP).
- Basketball Website - This is my first ever website I made and this is kind of a run-on website. In other words, unless you are a really big Basketball fan, that website will not mean much to you. It's basically NBA records, stats, and history (it was made in the summer of 2022, so be aware, it's not updated, and as of right now, I don't plan to update it in the future). It's long, which kind of makes it boring if you end up reading the whole thing. If you are interested, I'd suggest breaking it up so you don't get bored while reading. It might be a little bit fun.
